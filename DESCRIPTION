Description: This package contains the helper files that are required
        to run the Bioconductor package CopywriteR. It contains
        pre-assembled 1kb bin GC-content and mappability files for the
        reference genomes hg18, hg19, hg38, mm9 and mm10. In addition,
        it contains a blacklist filter to remove regions that display
        CNV. Files are stored as GRanges objects from the GenomicRanges
        Bioconductor package.
